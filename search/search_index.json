Cutting-edge palaeogenetic methods applied to ancient samples are uncovering a wealth of information, such as reconstructing species and human population histories, identifying the causative agents of devastating pandemics, revealing how past ecosystems responded to long-term environmental changes (both natural and anthropogenic), and reconstructing the microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, recovering this ancient genetic material requires destructive sampling of specimens that represent a finite, and often unique, form of cultural and/or natural heritage.</p> <p>The discipline of palaeogenomics has been recognized for its success in implementing open data practices (Anagnostou et al. 2015), which allow data and analytical reuse and reproduction. However, while DNA sequencing data are, in the majority of cases, made available on gold-standard public archives, these data are often not easily retrievable. This is mainly due to the inconsistencies in how these data, and more importantly, their metadata, are reported and archived. Furthermore, ancient samples can often have limited contextual information, as the original environment or background metadata have been long-lost. In addition, those that do exist are often reported in a fragmentary manner, and distributed across many different publications in different specialist journals and databases. As aDNA datasets continue to grow, this lack of standardised reporting is becoming increasingly problematic not just for researchers trying to reuse public data, but also for a wide range of stakeholders. For example, commercial companies may wish to leverage extinct biological diversity to find solutions to modern problems, such as finding new sources of antibiotics, cultural heritage managers (e.g. museum curators) may have difficulty tracking what samples have previously been analysed, and members of wider society and descendent communities may have difficulty accessing data relevant to their own heritage or general interests.</p> <p>This project proposes to build upon exisiting MIxS checklist to make them compatible with ancient DNA. This will involve generating a new 'ancient' extension that adds new metadata descriptors to include crucial context specific for ancient samples, extending and clarifying definitions of existing MIxS descriptors to ensure they are compatible with these types of samples. The third phase of the project will include a community-agreed standard set of minimum essential metadata for different ancient DNA sub-fields in the form of submission combinations, that should be uploaded alongside sequence data, to ensure consistency across the field and to make it easier for all parties to both upload and download aDNA data. We also aim for this schema to be used as a template for other biomolecular disciplines in archaeological science, given the often highly interdisciplinary nature of these fields. This, in turn, will encourage the complementary analyses of diverse data types, and help to maximise the value and longevity of data generated from the destructive analysis of irreplaceable ancient remains and samples. Achieving these goals is an absolute imperative for both the scientific and ethical advancement of the field of ancient DNA.

During sample selection, emphasis was given to the coracoid due to its higher density when compared to long bones. In the absence of this element in a given assemblage, long bones were selected. Prior to grinding, ~0.5mm of the exterior surface of the bone was removed using a Dremel 3000 electric hand-drill. No bleaching of the bone powder was conducted prior to DNA extraction, which followed the Dabney protocol (Dabney et al., 2013). Non-UDG treated Illumina libraries were generated following the double stranded DNA (ds) protocols of either Meyer &amp; Kircher (2010) or Car\u00f8e et al. (2018). These double-indexed libraries were then pooled at equimolar levels and shotgun sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500/4000/X (80-150 bp paired-end, PE).

These libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (80bp single-end, SE) and mapped against the Gallus gallus GRCg6a mitochondrial genome reference (NC040902.1). Meanwhile, libraries displaying higher endogenous DNA content were sequenced to greater depth for whole genome analysis on multiple Hi-Seq 2500 lanes (100bp SE).

Eighteen samples were found to present at least one MDV read.

Samples with uniquely mapped MDV reads of 25 bp or longer were identified as true positives for Marek\u2019s disease, resulting in fifteen ancient genomes with coverage depths ranging from 0.13x to 41.92x.

Once the different extensions are updated, we use a combination of LinkML commands and a toolkit developed by the MInAS team (mixs-toolkit) to combine the MInAS extensions with the current version of MIxS to generate the final set of MInAS checklists.</p> <p>These we then use the information from the combinations to update the contents of a 'selection wizard' that helps users select the right checklist for describing their samples. At the same time, we then pass the final MInAS LinkML YAML file to a slightly modified version of the DataHarmonizer tool which helps the aDNA community to review the proposed metadata terms. Both the selection wizard and DataHarmonizer interface are rendered on the MInAS website.</p> <p>We use both tools within what we term 'feedback sessions' that where have online calls where we consult with a wide variety of different stakeholders in ancient DNA research for the applicability and usefulness of the proposed metadata terms. We The MInAS team then collates and reviews the feedback from these sessions, and then updates the MInAS extensions and checklists YAML files accordingly.</p> <p></p> <p>The regular project timeline of the MInAS project is envisioned to be as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Feedback sessions: We run multiple feedback sessions with different members of the community to gather feedback on the next updates to the MInAS metadata schema.</li> <li>Development workshop: after multiple feedback sessions, the development team comes together into a workshop to review and build consensus on the feedback received, and finalise the proposed updates.</li> <li>Release meeting: The MInAS coordinators then incorporate the proposed changes into the LinkML YAML files makes GitHub releases, and updates the MInAS website with the new checklists and DataHarmonizer interface.</li> <li>GSC MIxS Review: (Envisioned) After we make a new release of the MInAS schemas, the development team will then submit our changes to the main MIxS project for review and incorporation into the main MIxS project and it's subsequent MIxS release that then are then taken and implemented by the ENA and other data archives.</li>

IDs.<ul> <li>You can also use more specific metagenome taxon IDs, such as those for specific environments (e.g. soil, marine, etc.).</li> <li>This is because all ancient DNA is intrinsically

A sample is either a negative control or not ... Would this also potentially not apply to all other tables? [AFG/BM] The problem with negative controls is that they come from diff batches so becomes hard to control. (M). Issue: in paleometagenome less negative controls are used as there is a more reliance on damage patterns and this is not the case for sedaDNA where negative controls should be mandatory. num_capture_reamp_cycles nan Number of amplification cycles after capture enrichment number of amplification cycles {integer} 10 sequencing C nan 1 MIXS:XXXXXXX Condition: if performed N nan num_reamp_cycles number of reamplification cycles Number of amplification cycles after library indexing PCR number of amplification cycles {integer} 8 sequencing C nan 1 MIXS:XXXXXXX Condition: if performed N nan preservational_treatment preservation treatment Description of any treatment applied to samples for the purpose of maximising collection preservation that may influence downstream DNA recovery or library construction, such as storage fluid or reconstructive glue text {text} stored in formalin nucleic acid sequence source C nan 1 MIXS:XXXXXXX Condition: if present N nan sample_alt_lab_ids alternative sample IDs Any alternate sample IDs used in by the research group publishing the paper or other groups.
