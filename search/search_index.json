Cutting-edge palaeogenetic methods applied to ancient samples are uncovering a wealth of information, such as reconstructing species and human population histories, identifying the causative agents of devastating pandemics, revealing how past ecosystems responded to long-term environmental changes (both natural and anthropogenic), and reconstructing the microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, recovering this ancient genetic material requires destructive sampling of specimens that represent a finite, and often unique, form of cultural and/or natural heritage.</p> <p>The discipline of palaeogenomics has been recognized for its success in implementing open data practices (Anagnostou et al. 2015), which allow data and analytical reuse and reproduction. However, while DNA sequencing data are, in the majority of cases, made available on gold-standard public archives, these data are often not easily retrievable. This is mainly due to the inconsistencies in how these data, and more importantly, their metadata, are reported and archived. Furthermore, ancient samples can often have limited contextual information, as the original environment or background metadata have been long-lost. In addition, those that do exist are often reported in a fragmentary manner, and distributed across many different publications in different specialist journals and databases. As aDNA datasets continue to grow, this lack of standardised reporting is becoming increasingly problematic not just for researchers trying to reuse public data, but also for a wide range of stakeholders. For example, commercial companies may wish to leverage extinct biological diversity to find solutions to modern problems, such as finding new sources of antibiotics, cultural heritage managers (e.g. museum curators) may have difficulty tracking what samples have previously been analysed, and members of wider society and descendent communities may have difficulty accessing data relevant to their own heritage or general interests.</p> <p>This project proposes to build upon exisiting MIxS checklist to make them compatible with ancient DNA. This will involve generating a new 'ancient' extension that adds new metadata descriptors to include crucial context specific for ancient samples, extending and clarifying definitions of existing MIxS descriptors to ensure they are compatible with these types of samples. The third phase of the project will include a community-agreed standard set of minimum essential metadata for different ancient DNA sub-fields in the form of submission combinations, that should be uploaded alongside sequence data, to ensure consistency across the field and to make it easier for all parties to both upload and download aDNA data. We also aim for this schema to be used as a template for other biomolecular disciplines in archaeological science, given the often highly interdisciplinary nature of these fields. This, in turn, will encourage the complementary analyses of diverse data types, and help to maximise the value and longevity of data generated from the destructive analysis of irreplaceable ancient remains and samples. Achieving these goals is an absolute imperative for both the scientific and ethical advancement of the field of ancient DNA. Without proper curation of our past, we neither understand our present nor shape our future.</p>"},{"location":"about/proposal/#project-initiation-date-can-be-a-date-or-a-narrative-about-how-and-when-the-project-started-and-how-it-is-proceeding","title":"Project initiation date (can be a date or a narrative about how and when the project started and how it is proceeding)","text":"<p>Independent discussions regarding metadata reporting standards occurred throughout 2020 and 2021 within workshops of different aDNA communities (SPAAM - Standards, Precautions and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics, CIADR - Current Issues in Ancient DNA Research, and the sedaDNA scientific society).</p> <p>The project for the MInAS checklist was established in January 2022.</p>"},{"location":"about/proposal/#what-will-this-project-aim-to-contribute-to-the-gsc","title":"What will this project aim to contribute to the GSC","text":"<p>This project will aim to extend GSC checklists via extensions and develop submission combinations compatible with aDNA data.</p>"},{"location":"about/proposal/#have-you-spoken-about-the-project-already-within-gsc-on-a-call-at-a-formal-gsc-meeting-would-like-to-request-time-to-present-at-a-future-meeting","title":"Have you spoken about the project already within GSC (on a call, at a formal GSC meeting, would like to request time to present at a future meeting)","text":"<p>The project has been already discussed with Lynn Schriml and Ramona Walls by Antonio Fern\u00e0ndez-Guerra (GSC21 2018).

Data querying and retrieval can then occur in the sequencing databases themselves. Furthermore, by initially focusing on descriptors that already apply across multiple disciplines, this will also increase the likelihood of the extension and proposed submission combinations being applicable to new sub-disciplines of ancient DNA in the future as they emerge.

During sample selection, emphasis was given to the coracoid due to its higher density when compared to long bones. In the absence of this element in a given assemblage, long bones were selected. Prior to grinding, ~0.5mm of the exterior surface of the bone was removed using a Dremel 3000 electric hand-drill. No bleaching of the bone powder was conducted prior to DNA extraction, which followed the Dabney protocol (Dabney et al., 2013). Non-UDG treated Illumina libraries were generated following the double stranded DNA (ds) protocols of either Meyer &amp; Kircher (2010) or Car\u00f8e et al. (2018). These double-indexed libraries were then pooled at equimolar levels and shotgun sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500/4000/X (80-150 bp paired-end, PE). The resulting sequenced data was mapped against the Gallus gallus GRCg6a genome reference (GCF_000002315.6).</p> <p>Based on the assessment of endogenous DNA in each sample, selected amplified libraries underwent enrichment for mitochondrial genomes using MYbaits (MYcroarray) with a 24-hour hybridisation at 55\u00b0C based on the MYbaits manual V3 (2016). These libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (80bp single-end, SE) and mapped against the Gallus gallus GRCg6a mitochondrial genome reference (NC040902.1). Meanwhile, libraries displaying higher endogenous DNA content were sequenced to greater depth for whole genome analysis on multiple Hi-Seq 2500 lanes (100bp SE). This newly-generated data was mapped against the _Gallus gallus GRCg6a genome reference (GCF_000002315.6).</p> <p>Marek's disease virus (MDV) is a highly contagious alphaherpesvirus that causes a tumor-associated disease in poultry. To investigate its evolutionary history, the shotgun sequenced libraries were screened for the Gallid Alphaherpesvirus 2 (Marek Disease Virus type 1, MDV) genome using HAYSTAC (Dimopoulos et al., 2018 based on a custom database of complete herpesvirus genomes selected from the NCBI RefSeq database. Eighteen samples were found to present at least one MDV read. To validate the methodology, a feather sample from a modern chicken showing MDV symptoms, and a negative control consisting of an ancient sample with no MDV reads upon screening, were also included, totalling the number of samples to 20.</p> <p>These 20 amplified ds libraries were subsequently enriched for viral DNA using a hybridisation-based capture approach based on RNA baits designed to cover the entire Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2 genome (strain RB-1B; NCBI accession EF523390.1). These were then paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq lane (150bp PE), generating MDV-specific sequencing files. Samples with uniquely mapped MDV reads of 25 bp or longer were identified as true positives for Marek\u2019s disease, resulting in fifteen ancient genomes with coverage depths ranging from 0.13x to 41.92x.

taxonomy IDs.</p> <p>These represent different types of taxonomic information for different purposes.</p> <p>For all ancient DNA sequencing data (e.g FASTQ files or BAM files), that you upload to the

IDs.<ul> <li>You can also use more specific metagenome taxon IDs, such as those for specific environments (e.g. soil, marine, etc.).</li> <li>This is because all ancient DNA is intrinsically metagenomic in nature, as they contain other organisms from the burial environment, and not just the host organism.</li> </ul> </li> <li>host_taxid:<ul> <li>This taxon ID should be the NCBI taxonomy
