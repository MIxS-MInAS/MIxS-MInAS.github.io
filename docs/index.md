## About

- 💾 Palaeogenomic data is routinely shared on public databases
- 🏷️ Metadata? Not so good…

_The **M**inimum **In**formation about any **A**ncient **S**equence (**MInAS**) project aims to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes for any ancient DNA sample and sequencing data via community-based consensus and training._

🏗️ This project builds from and interacts with the [Genomics Standards Consortium's](https://www.gensc.org/) (GSC) [MIxS project](https://www.gensc.org/pages/standards-intro.html).

      To view the latest version of the MInAS schema, please see the [MInAS DataHarmonizer](https://www.mixs-minas.org/MInAS-DataHarmonizer/).
      Use the 'Template' dropdown to select a relevant [combination](schema/combinations.md), and the help sidebar for metadata term definitions.
      For more details see the [drafts](schema/index.md) pages.

ℹ️ See the [project proposal](about/proposal.md) submitted to the GSC for further context and motivations behind the project.
For the planned phases of the project, see [Project Phases](about/phases.md).
To see the latest drafts, please see the respective [Draft](schema/index.md) page.

🤝 We are actively looking for other palaeogenomic communities and groups to get involved with the project - please see [Get Involved](about/get-involved.md) if you are interested.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The MInAS project was originally spearheaded by the [SPAAM Community](https://spaam-community.github.io), however has developed it's own community encompassing all areas of palaeogenomics.
