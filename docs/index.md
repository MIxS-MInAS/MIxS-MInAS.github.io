## About

- üíæ Palaeogenomic data is routinely shared on public databases
- üè∑Ô∏è Metadata? Not so good‚Ä¶

**The MInAS project aims to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes of ancient DNA samples and sequencing data via community-based consensus and training.**

This project builds from and interacts with the [Genomics Standards Consortium's](https://www.gensc.org/) (GSC) [MIxS project](https://www.gensc.org/pages/standards-intro.html).

See the [project proposal](/proposal) submitted to the GSC for further context and motivations behind the project. For the planned phases of the project, see [Project Phases](/phases). To see the latest drafts, please see the respective [Draft](/draft) page.

ü§ù We are activately looking for other palaeogenomic communities and groups to get involved with the project - please get in contact if you are interested.

Currently, the MINAS project is being spearheaded by the [SPAAM Community](https://spaam-community.github.io).
If you're interested in getting involved in the project, please join the [SPAAM Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spaam-community/shared_invite/zt-ei8pfw4m-XdBGTQwRaXWrEkd618YlhQ) and join the channel [#metadata-standards](https://spaam-community.slack.com/archives/C01BX7EM4EL).
You can also directly contact [Antonio Fernandez-Guerra](https://globe.ku.dk/research/geogenetics/microbial-ecogenomics-group/) or [James Fellows Yates](https://www.eva.mpg.de/archaeogenetics/staff/james-fellows-yates/) either via Slack or [info@mixs-minas.org](mailto:info@mixs-minas.org).
