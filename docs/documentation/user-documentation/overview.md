# User documentation overview

The purpose of the user documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide for scientists how to use and fill in MInAS metadata checklists.

In the future this will contain examples, tutorials and best practices for using the MInAS framework effectively.

Currently this consists of a ['Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQ)](faq.md) page for addressing common questions that are regularly brought up in [MInAS Feedback Sessions](../project-documentation/contributing.md).
