# MInAS Combinations

<!-- UPDATE VERSION HERE ON EACH UPDATE -->

!!! info "Version"

    The current version is: `v0.0.2`.

!!! warning

    This can be considered a pre-alpha version, and has not been reviewed nor approved by the wider palaeogenomics community nor by the Genomics Standards Consortium.

The following submission combinationss have been proposed by the SPAAM community to act as starting points for discussions. **Not all types of ancient DNA research will currently be covered here**, however the sub-fields should cover the vast majority of _current_ research in the field. As the MInAS project develops, these default minimum-information submission combinationss will be extended to include other areas.

All MInAS submission combinationss will include the [Ancient](ancient-extension.md) extension.
