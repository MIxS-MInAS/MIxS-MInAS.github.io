This can be considered a pre-alpha version, and has not been reviewed nor approved by the wider palaeogenomics community nor by the Genomics Standards Consortium.

For the current release of the base MIxS checklists and other extensions, please see the [GenSC](https://www.gensc.org/pages/standards/checklists.html) and/or [MIxS](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/) websites.
