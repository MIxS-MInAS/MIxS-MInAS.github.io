# Drafts

The MInAS project drafts can be split into three different sections:

- the new 'ancient' extension (containing new MIxS terms for ancient samples)
- the existing MIxS terms update and clarifications,
- the MInAS standard MIxS checklist combinations

You can see the drafts of each stages in the respective pages in this section.
