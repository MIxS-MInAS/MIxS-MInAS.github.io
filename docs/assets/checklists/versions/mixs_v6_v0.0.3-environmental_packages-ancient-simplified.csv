neg_cont_status,negative control status,Specify whether the sample is a negative control or not.,negative control status,{boolean},NA,investigation,X,NA,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,None,Y,[JAFY] Wouldn't this be mandatory if it's boolean? A sample is either a negative control or not ... Would this also potentially not apply to all other tables? [AFG/BM] The problem with negative controls is that they come from diff batches so becomes hard to control. (M). Issue: in paleometagenome less negative controls are used as there is a more reliance on damage patterns and this is not the case for sedaDNA where negative controls should be mandatory.
