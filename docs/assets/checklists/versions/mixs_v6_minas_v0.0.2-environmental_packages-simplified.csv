host-associated,environment,burial_context,Description of the burial context from which sampled indivuals were recovered,enumeration,[primary inhumation|secondary inhumation|multiple inhumation|commingled assemblage|disartuclated remains|information not available],multiple inhumation,X,NA,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,Y,Is there some form of ontology for such a thing?,NA
host-associated,environment,host_biological_sex,Biological sex of the host individual,enumeration,[male|female|other|unknown],female,X,NA,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,N,NA,NA
human-oral,environment,samp_sample_site,Specific location in oral cavity,enumeration,{termLabel} {[termID]},maxilla left 3rd molar [UBERON:0002535],X,NA,m,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,N,NA,NA
sediment,environment,sediment_type,"The sediment type. E.g. silt, clay, organic, porous.",text,{text},cave,X,NA,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,Y,[PH/AI] Very important for molecular scientists to be able to distinguish between the different sediment types perhaps a blog post or workshop for the sedaDNA society from a sedimentologists,NA
sediment,environment,sedimentation_rate,The sedimentation rate calculated from age depths models.,value,{integer},???,X,NA,???,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,Y,[???] but with NA as its not always available.,NA
sediment,sampling,coring_system,"Specify whether the sampling was with open or closed system. An open system is where no corers are used and the samples are exposed, e.g. in caves. A closed system is where a corer is used and the sampling procedure is ‘controlled’.",enumeration,[open|closed],closed,X,NA,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,N,NA,NA
sediment,sampling,depths,The depths at which the sediments where taken from. This depends on the source of sediments. E.g. water depths.,value,{integer},???,X,cm,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,N,[???] Should influence microbial activity (M) But include NA in the options as not applicable for all samples.,NA
sediment,sampling,stratigraphic_horizon,"The depths at which the samples from the sediments were taken from the core. E.g. from a one meter long core, the sample corresponds to depths 50 cm and from caves from the surface. (M)",value,{integer},???,X,???,1,MIXS:XXXXXXX,N,Y,"[JAFY] the description here seems to correspond to depths, I think this needs to be revised",NA
